# Lucillian Binary Font
This is a font created in [Birdfont](https://birdfont.org/), for the display of Lucillian binary notation, as shown in the video "the best way to count" by @lucitone.
## Usage
The font currently includes only a handful of characters, so you should only set numbers as this font. `1` and `0` behave as expected. `.` renders as the "decimal" separator. The "rep" / repeating mark is `r`, and the left-repeating mark is `l`. To group digits, place an `_` between the digits you want to connect with a baseline. In addition to using the left-repeating mark to display two's complement negatives, a negative sign is available at `-`.
